            information about future changes to these Terms, automatic renewals,

        <div className={s.content}>
          <p>
            We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may
            need to change along with our Services. We reserve the right to
            change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will place a notice
            on our site located at replay.io, send you an email, and/or notify
            you by some other means.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them;
            unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the
            Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the
            Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.
            Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or
            modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and
            signed by both you and us.

          <p>
            The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that
            online service providers obtain parental consent before they
            knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from
            children who are under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect
            or solicit personally identifiable information from children under

            not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us
            any personal information. If we learn we have collected personal
            information from a child under 13 years of age, we will delete that
            information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child
            under 13 years of age may have provided us personal information,

        <div className={s.content}>
          <p>
            You may be required to sign up for an account, select a password and
            user name (“Replay User ID”), and provide us with certain
            information or data, such as your contact information. You promise
            to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration
            information about yourself. You may not select as your Replay User
            ID a name that you do not have the right to use, or another person’s
            name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not
            transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written
            permission.
            <br />
            <br />
            Additionally, you may be able to access certain parts or features of
            the Services by using your account credentials from other services
            (each, a “Third Party Account”), such as those offered by Google. By
            using the Services through a Third Party Account, you permit us to
            access certain information from such account for use by the
            Services. You are ultimately in control of how much information is
            accessible to us and may exercise such control by adjusting your
            privacy settings on your Third Party Account. You represent and
            warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding
            contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s
            permission to use the Services and have gotten your parent or
            guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf). If you’re agreeing
            to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent
            and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that
            organization’s or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in
            which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms,
            except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).
            <br />
            <br />
            You will only use the Services for your own internal, non-commercial
            use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and
            only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If
            your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you
            aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be
            responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the
            law.
            <br />
            <br />
            You will not share your Replay User ID, account or password with
            anyone, and you must protect the security of your Replay User ID,
            account, password and any other access tools or credentials. You’re
            responsible for any activity associated with your Replay User ID and
            account.

            certain rights in those User Submissions (see below for more
            information). Please note that all of the following licenses are
            subject to our <Link href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</Link> to
            the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your
            personally-identifiable information.
            <br />
            <br />
            For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Replay a license to
            translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example, making sure
            your content is viewable on a mobile device as well as a computer)
            and reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User
            Submissions, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as
            described in more detail below. This is a license only – your
            ownership in User Submissions is not affected.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you store a User Submission in your own personal Replay account,
            in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a
            “Personal User Submission”), you grant Replay the license above, as
            well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal
            User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User
            Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to
            do so.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you share a User Submission in a manner that only certain
            specified users can view (for example, a private message to one or
            more other users) (a “Limited Audience User Submission”), then you
            grant Replay the licenses above, as well as a license to display,
            perform, and distribute your Limited Audience User Submission for
            the sole purpose of making that Limited Audience User Submission
            accessible to such other specified users, and providing the Services
            necessary to do so. Also, you grant such other specified users a
            license to access that Limited Audience User Submission, and to use
            and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of
            the Services.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a
            manner that more than just you or certain specified users can view,
            or if you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any
            feedback, suggestions, improvements, enhancements, and/or feature
            requests relating to the Services (each of the foregoing, a “Public
            User Submission”), then you grant Replay the licenses above, as well
            as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User
            Submission for the purpose of making that Public User Submission
            accessible to all Replay users and providing the Services necessary
            to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise
            all rights in that Public User Submission in connection with the
            Services and/or otherwise in connection with Replay's business.
            Also, you grant all other users of the Services a license to access
            that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in
            it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.
            <br />
            <br />
            You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual,
            sublicensable, irrevocable, and worldwide, provided that when you
            delete your Replay account, we will stop displaying your User
            Submissions (other than Public User Submissions, which may remain
            fully available) to other users (if applicable), but you understand
            and agree that it may not be possible to completely delete that
            content from Replay's records, and that your User Submissions may
            remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or
            stored by other users.
            <br />
            <br />
            Certain features of the Services allow you to share information with

              Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent.
            </strong>{' '}
            If the content provider believes that the material that was removed
            (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content
            provider believes that it has the right to post and use such
            material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or,
            pursuant to the law, the content provider may send us a
            counter-notice containing the following information to the
            Designated Agent:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A physical or electronic signature of the content provider;</li>
            <li>

              access has been disabled and the location at which the material
              appeared before it was removed or disabled;
            </li>
            <li>
              A statement that the content provider has a good faith belief that
              the material was removed or disabled as a resolt of mistake or
              misidentification of the material; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Content provider's name, address, telephone number, and, if
              available, email address, and a statement that such person or
              entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the
              judicial district in which the content provider’s address is
              located, or, if the content provider's address is located outside
              the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is
              located, and that such person or entity will accept service of
              process from the person who provided notification of the alleged
              infringement.

          <p>
            If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company
            may, in its discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the
            original complaining party informing that person that Company may
            replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business
            days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court
            order against the content provider accused of committing
            infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it
            restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the
            counter-notice, at Company's discretion.

              <strong>Reaffirmation of Authorization.</strong> Your
              non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that
              we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid
              Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be
              responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to
              seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in
              advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you
              initially selected to use the Paid Service.

            violation of these Terms. In the event of such a claim, suit, or
            action (“Claim”), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to
            the contact information we have for your account (provided that
            failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your

            <strong>Choice of Law.</strong> These Terms are governed by and will
            be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal

            <strong>Arbitration Agreement.</strong> Please read the following
            ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate
            certain disputes and claims with Replay and limits the manner in
            which you can seek relief from Replay. Both you and Replay
            acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising
            out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Replay's
            officers, directors, employees and independent contractors
            (“Personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that
            upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right
            (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these
            Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. The
              parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim,
              question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the
              subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith
              negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party
              initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the
              dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in
              Santa Clara County, California. The arbitration will proceed in
              the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined
              Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then in effect, by
              one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving
              intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The
              arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS
              arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award
              rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of
              competent jurisdiction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Costs of Arbitration. The Rules will govern payment of all
              arbitration fees. Replay will pay all arbitration fees for claims
              less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars. Replay will not
              seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the
              arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
            </li>
            <li>
              Small Claims Court; Infringement. Either you or Replay may assert
              claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Santa Clara
              County, California or any United States county where you live or
              work. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to
              arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue
              injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court
              of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened
              infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's
              copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other
              intellectual property rights.
            </li>
            <li>
              Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND REPLAY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND
              STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A
              JUDGE OR JURY. You and Replay are instead choosing to have claims
              and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are
              typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules
              applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a
              court. In any litigation between you and Replay over whether to
              vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND REPLAY WAIVE ALL
              RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be
              resolved by a judge.
            </li>
            <li>
              Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES
              WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED
              OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.
              CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR
              LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER
              OR USER. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions
              is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Replay is
              entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be
              resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.
            </li>
            <li>
              Opt-out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this
              Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to
              the following address: 548 Market St, PMB 78081, San Francisco, CA
              94104, postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these
              Terms. You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii)
              the email address and/or telephone number associated with your
              account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of
              these Terms’ arbitration agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
              Exclusive Venue. If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in
              any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement
              permits either you or Replay to litigate any dispute arising out
              of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then
              the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either
              party, and both you and Replay agree that any judicial proceeding
              (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or
              federal courts located in, respectively, Santa Clara County,
              California, or the federal district in which that county falls.
            </li>
            <li>
              Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other
              claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found
              to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this
              Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void. This
              arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your
              relationship with Replay.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> You will be responsible for paying,
            withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other
            governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection
            with the Services, provided that the Replay may, in its sole
            discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as
            it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any
            way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further
            rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms are found to be
            unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or
            eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms
            shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You
            and Replay agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive
            statement of the mutual understanding between you and Replay, and
            that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral
            agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the
            subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that
            you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Replay,
            and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Replay in any
            respect whatsoever.
            <br />
            <br />
            Except as expressly set forth in the section above regarding the
            arbitration agreement, you and Replay agree there are no third-party
            beneficiaries intended under these Terms.

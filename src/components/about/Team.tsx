He spends much of his time answering questions about React and Redux anywhere there's a comment box on the internet, and usually hangs out in the Reactiflux chat channels. Mark is also disturbed at the number of third-person references he has written in this bio.`,

    bio: `Dominik's two decades of software engineering adventures involved building MMORPG servers, optimizing CUDA algorithms and building/debugging full-stack applications. After getting frustrated about the inability to directly analyze his own systems' control and data flow, he dedicated his PhD dissertation to exploring and finding novel solutions for exactly that problem. Originally from Germany, he has been living in Taiwan for most of his adult life.`
